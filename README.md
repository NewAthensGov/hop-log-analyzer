This is a python project that is meant to be a companion app to Konami (DeadEye)'s [script](http://the-boat.ddns.net) for tracking players in your lobby. Take the output file from that script and use it with this one to automatically analyze and format the log for ease of use.

| OS | Setup |

3. Drag and drop the hop output text file into the app window.
4. Profit.
